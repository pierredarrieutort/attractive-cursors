## Reason of being
Today many sites want to differentiate themselves by their original and unique style.

Several problems remain :
- First, the fact of ignoring a "Call-To-Action" too sophisticated or so sober that it does not attract the eye.
- Second, making the focus of an element more visible.
- In other cases, wanting to make the user click on an item explicitly.

The purpose of this project is therefore to provide those who want a simple and flexible solution to highlight the "Call-To-Action" of their site. 

## Demo

## Getting Started
A tiny & simple **step-by-step tutorial** is available here : https://attractive-cursors.vercel.app/tutorial.html

## Behavior types

> The project shows three types of behavior but you can see in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section that **they are complementary** and can work together without conflict. You can see them working together in the [Demo](#demo).

- ### Sticky
   The *"Sticky"* behavior attracts the mouse's rounded shape to the button area and maintain it when user's pointer is in the dedicated parent area.

- ### Magnetic
   The *"Magnetic"* behavior displaces the content near to the mouse when user's pointer is in the dedicated parent area.

- ### Autoscaled
   The *"Autoscaled"* behavior use the [hypotenuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotenuse) of area to scale the mouse's rounded shape to the first child of dedicated parent area.
