    p To enable all cursors effects you need to import it from the library.
    p
      code import { Cursor } from 'attractive-cursor'
    main
      section
        h2 Structure
        .substructure
          .item
            .content

            p In red dotted : our dedicated area.
            p In green solid : the target element.
            i (If multiple elements are targeted, the behavior is applied to the first one. So put multiple elements in ONE dedicated parent).
      section
        h2 Apply a dedicated behavior type
        .substructure

            p We want to apply a stick effect on child when hovering the dark area.
            p So we add the class
              code cursor-stick-area
              | to the dark parent of the targeted element (the light one).
            p Now if you move your mouse in the dark area, the cursor will stick on light area.
      section
        h2 Add effect on cursor when hovering element
        .substructure
          .cursor-stick-area.item(data-cursor="-exclusion,-large")
            .content
          .explanation
            p Now we want to add a large effect on the cursor when hovering the targeted element.
            p So we add
              code data-cursor='-large'
              | attribute to the targeted element.
            p Now if you move your mouse in the dark area, the cursor will stick on light area and will have a large effect.
            i You can also add
              code -exclusion
              | to the attribute to add a exclusion blending effect. (To add it, separate the values with a comma and WHITHOUT a space).
